# angular-gettext - gettext utilities for angular.js

> Translate your Angular.JS applications with gettext.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/angular-gettext.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubenv/angular-gettext)

## Getting started

Add angular-gettext to your project:

1. Grab the files, either by copying the files from the `dist` folder or (preferably) through bower: `bower install --save angular-gettext`.
2. Include the angular-gettext source files in your app:
   
   ```
   <script src="bower_components/angular-gettext/dist/angular-gettext.min.js"></script>
   ```
   
3. Add a dependency to angular-gettext in your Angular app:

   ```
   angular.module('myApp', ['gettext']);
   ```
   
You can now start using the `translate` directive to mark strings as translatable.

Next steps:

* Annotate strings with the `translate` directive.
* Extract strings from the source code.
* Translate strings
* Integrate translated strings back into the application.
* Set the correct language for translations.

## Using the `translate` directive

Strings are marked as translatable using the `translate` directive. Here's a simple example:

```
 <h1 translate>Hello!</h1>
```

This div will automatically be translated using the translated strings (which we'll define later on). For instance, in Dutch, it might read `Hallo!`.

### Plurals

Plural strings can be annotated using two extra attributes: `translate-n` and `translate-plural`:

```
 <div translate translate-n="count" translate-plural="{{count}} boats">One boat</div>
```

The general format is:

```
 <div translate translate-n="COUNTEXPR" translate-plural="PLURALSTR">SINGULARSTR</div>
```

Depending on the value of `COUNTEXPR`, either the singular string or the plural string will be selected.

### Interpolation

Full interpolation support is available in translated strings, so the following will work as expected:

```
 <div translate>Hello {{name}}!</div>
```

## Extracting strings

TODO (module being built)

## Translate strings

Use a tool like [poedit](http://www.poedit.net/), [Pootle](http://pootle.translatehouse.org/) or [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to translate the strings.

## Setting translated strings

You can set translated strings by injecting the `gettextCatalog` and using the `setStrings` method.

As an example, you may have the following code in your application:

```
angular.module('myApp').run(function (gettextCatalog) {
    // Load the strings automatically during initialization.
    gettextCatalog.setStrings('nl', {
        'Hello': 'Hallo',
        'One boat': ['Een boot', '{{count}} boats']
    });
});
```

Converting translated `.po` files into angular-compatible JavaScript files can be done automatically using the `grunt-angular-gettext` module.

## Setting the language

Set the language by setting a language code on the catalog:

```
angular.module('myApp').run(function (gettextCatalog) {
    gettextCatalog.currentLanguage = 'nl';
});
```

You can do this anywhere in your application, the use of a `run` block above is just an example.

## Contributing
All code lives in the `src` folder and is written in CoffeeScript. Try to stick to the style conventions used in existing code.

Tests can be run using `grunt test`. A convenience command to automatically run the tests is also available: `grunt watch`. Please add test cases when adding new functionality: this will prove that it works and ensure that it will keep working in the future.
